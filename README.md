# About Me

## My Interests

### Personal Interests

I am a passionate meteorologist who loves storm chasing and understanding weather patterns. Teaching science is one of my favorite activities, and I'm dedicated to our new nonprofit organization, **Storm Chaser’s Assistance Network (SCANet)**. In my free time, I enjoy playing softball, watching hockey or football, indulging in Mini M&M’s, and exploring my newest hobby of learning how to make websites.

### Family

Family is at the heart of my life. I have two teenage daughters and a middle school son who keep me busy and inspired every day. Sharing our love for meteorology and storm chasing together has strengthened our bond and created unforgettable memories.
