2.	I am new to GitHub and I am using this account to learn how to make repositories, make websites, and learn to code better.
3.	HurricaneKrissy.github.io is the GitHub page website repository I am working on for my course. 
4.	I downloaded GitHub Desktop. Then I opened it to clone my repository and chose the option "Clone a Repository". Then, I chose the folder on my computer where I wanted the repository to be saved. After that, I found the folder, opened it, and selected the README file to be opened in Notepad and I added this information.
